            <p>2 Live Crew rapper Brother Marquis has passed away at the age of 58, according to the pioneering group.

                The Miami-based collective announced the news on Monday (June 3), writing on social media: “Mark Ross
                AKA
                Brother Marquis of the 2 Live crew has passed away,” although no further details — including a cause of
                death —
                were given.

                Tributes from around the Hip Hop world were paid to Marquis, most notably from fellow 2 Live Crew member
                Uncle
                Luke.

                “My Condolence goes out to the Family of Brother Marquis and so many of his Fans from around the World
                after
                learning his passing,” Luke wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “We took on so many fights for the culture
                made
                Great
                music together something I would never forget.

                “We had recently got back together to take on another fight to get back our catalog that was stolen from
                us.
                We
                will continue that fight in his name for his Family. The Brother Marquis, that I know would want us to
                celebrate
                his life that’s exactly what I’m gonna do. R.I.P My Brother.”</p>

            <p>Public Enemy’s Flava Flav also posted a picture of himself with the late rapper and wrote: “rest in peace
                bro.
                Marquise And china man of 2Live Crew.”

                Rob Base also paid tribute, commenting on 2 Live Crew’s above Instagram post: “My condolences [flowers
                emoji] so
                sad to hear this.”

                Born in Rochester, New York, Brother Marquis rose to fame in the late ’80s as part of 2 Live Crew, who
                became
                embroiled in controversy over their explicit lyrics.

                Their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be was deemed obscene by a court in Florida and later became banned
                in
                the
                U.S. before the ruling was overturned.</p>
